# SKYHIGH

Creating a mobile application with the Flutter Framework involves initiating a POST request to one of the designated SkyHigh API endpoints. This API responds with sales data spanning the past four years in JSON format. The application is designed to visualize this data through various chart types, including bar charts, pie charts, composite bar charts, time series charts, and tables. Additionally, users of the app have the capability to apply filters to specific columns, enabling them to extract valuable insights that will inform the forthcoming marketing promotion for the business.
